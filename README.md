# Titanfall 2 *thing*
# *thing* = Demos, Spectating, Camera Tool

## What to call it?
Since demos, spectating, camera tool, and other terms are all different but are mainly close enough, so I will refer to these items as "Camera Tool". In short TF2CT; Titanfall 2 Camera Tool.

# TF2CT (Titanfall 2 Camera Tool)

# State of TF2CT
Titanfall 2 Camera Tool's are broken fundamentally. There is a chance for this to be fixed, but we'd need help from [Northstar](northstar.tf) devs. As they are very skilled and conquered thought to be impossible tasks such as custom models, custom maps, and custom textures.
