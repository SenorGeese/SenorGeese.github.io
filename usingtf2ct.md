# Recording in Vanilla TF2

## Toggling HUD

You most likely don't your HUD showing up in your cinematics. 

- ToggleHUD

    Easiest to use, intuitive, and not super hard to install. Drag and drop files into your game directory.

## Toggling viewmodel

Your viewmodel shows up when you are freecaming with the camera tool. So it's recommended you use some method to get it out of your way.

- Theather Mode VPK

    Moves weapons and removes some UI. Pre-edited files, just create it into a mod.

- Weapons Relocation VPK

    Moves weapons. Pre-edited files, just create it into a mod.

- Custom Invisible Weapons VPK mod

    Make a mod that turns all or some weapons invisible. You'll need to create a VTF skin mod.

## Camera Tool: 

Only works in TF2. Allows to use the current players camera and fly it around like freecam.

## Demos/Cinematics/Theater Mode/Movie

We will call *these* "Demos/Cinematics/Theater Mode/Movie" function/file demos. 

This is the broken part of TF2CT. Demos stutter every few seconds and there is no tool to assist in recording, managing, viewing, or editing demos.

### How to record demos

- launch options
- custom .cfg
- learn how it records
- learn how to run
